# Are we the baddies?

## Yes

### How tribalism is killing the world

I don't care which side of the political spectrum you fall on.

* Democrat
* Republican
* Socialist (and all the variants: Maoist, Marxist, etc)
* Democrat Socialist / Social Democrat
* Tea Party
* MAGA / Trump Supporter
* Independent
* Anarcho Socialist (Libertarian left)
* Anarchoist Capitalist (Libertarian right)

If you're on facebook or twitter and are in a group that discusses politics at all, chances are you nodded your head and said, yeah, that makes sense. I agree with that.

Agree with something enough times, and it begins to become part of you. Something that's hard to separate from the core of who you are.

As an undiagnosed professionally but probably an autistic technocrat, with ADHD. I find myself less attaching to one idea, but floating around from idea to idea.

An aside: I don't mean to offend any with the 'undiagnosed autistic bit', but my son has it, and many of my friends and my brother have it, and 90% of the autistic people I've met have said I definitely have it. It's the word vomit, I go hog wire over a topic I'm obsessed about in the moment. I have been diagnosed with ADHD in-attentive.

I've changed my allegiances many times the past few years not because I'm weak minded, but because I question everything, everyone, and their motives behind what they do.

I've sent tweet storms of rage at #MAGA and my fair share at Pelosi or McConnel or Donald Trump even.

I'm not a saint. Emotions get the best of me. It's lately though that I've begun to realize that there are common threads surrounding everything going on. I'm beginning to realize the techno-savior left is full of fascism lovers as much as the #MAGA loving right, and the centrists on both sides ARE the fascists.

## What is Fascism?

To understand where I'm coming from we first need to understand what fascism is, and this itself is a huge undertaking. There are MANY differing definitions.

**Merriam Webster's definition of fascism reads:**

> "a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition" [<sup>Merriam Webster</sup>](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism)

**The wikipedia defnition paraphrased reads:**

> Fascism is a far-right ultra-nationalism based authoritarian form of government.

> Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete and regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.

> A fascist state is led by a strong leader such as a dictator and a martial law government composed of the members of the governing fascist party to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.

> Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views imperialism, political violence and war as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.

> Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky (national economic self-sufficiency) through protectionist and economic interventionist policies.

> The extreme authoritarianism of fascism usually manifests itself in the belief in a "pure race" or "master race", usually synthesized with some variant of racism or bigotry; the idea of "purity" has motivated fascist regimes to commit massacres, forced sterilization, genocides, or forced deportations against a perceived other.

Pause. Take a breath. That's a lot to take in, let's switch gears for a moment. We'll come back to this. Not everything is black and white, there are many hues in nature, so there is in political spectrums.

## What is Corporatism?

> Corporatism is the organization of a society into industrial and professional corporations serving as organs of political representation and exercising control over persons and activities within their jurisdiction.  [<sup>Merriam Webster</sup>](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/corporatism)

Well, that didn't explain much. (I'm learning as  I write this too!). Oh, wait what if we add fascism to corporatism.

You ever play one of those mobile games usually names alchemy or some derivation of that? Where you mix elements like water and dirt to discover mud?

Apparently you can do the same thing with just about any political ideology. Even fascism! Cool huh?

**So a better question is what is Fascist Corporatism?**

> A fascist corporation is a government body that brings together federations of workers and employers syndicates to regulate production in a holistic manner. Each trade union would theoretically represent its professional concerns, especially by negotiation of labour contracts and the like. It was theorized that this method could result in harmony amongst social classes.
> However, authors have noted that historically de facto economic corporatism was also used to reduce opposition and reward political loyalty. [<sup>Wikipedia</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism#Fascist_corporatism)

**There's also Progressive Corporatism:**

> These corporatists supported providing group rights to members of the middle classes and working classes in order to secure cooperation among the classes. This was in opposition to the Marxist conception of class conflict. [<sup>Wikipedia</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism#Progressive_corporatism)

**Not to be confused with Liberal Corporatism:**

> is largely self-organized between labor and management, with only a supporting role for government. [<sup>Wikipedia</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism#Liberal_corporatism)

And then there's Neo Corporatism (Think democratic socialism, or European socialism.):
> During the post-World War II reconstruction period in Europe, corporatism was favoured by Christian democrats (often under the influence of Catholic social teaching), national conservatives and social democrats in opposition to liberal capitalism. This type of corporatism became unfashionable but revived again in the 1960s and 1970s as "neo-corporatism" in response to the new economic threat of recession-inflation.

> Neo-corporatism favoured economic tripartism, which involved strong labour unions, employers' associations and governments that cooperated as "social partners" to negotiate and manage a national economy.

> Social corporatist systems instituted in Europe after World War II include the ordoliberal system of the social market economy in Germany, the social partnership in Ireland, the polder model in the Netherlands (although arguably the polder model already was present at the end of World War I, it was not until after World War II that a social service system gained foothold there), the concertation system in Italy, the Rhine model in Switzerland and the Benelux countries and the Nordic model in Scandinavia.

> Attempts in the United States to create neo-corporatist capital-labor arrangements were unsuccessfully advocated by Gary Hart and Michael Dukakis in the 1980s. As secretary of labor during the Clinton administration, Robert Reich promoted neo-corporatist reforms [<sup>Wikipedia</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism#Neo-corporatism)

It should be noted that Robert Reich has also been a Bernie surrogate and leftist thought leader for years. As an economist he has many decent videos on how economics work. However, I'm trying to pain a holistic picture of everything swirling around. This is just the iceberg. Reich gets many things wrong too.

So if you're a fan of populists like AOC and Bernie they're really not all that populist.

**So, what is the origin of corporatism?**

Like everything else in American politics, this was ripped from Ancient Greece. (We steal everything!)

Plato came up with the concepts of totalitarian and communitarian corporatist systems. Basically he described people as having a 'place in society' based on their natural inclinations and purposes: priests, rulers,slaves, warriors.

That sounds far fetched from modern society, but let me put this into modern context:

### Priests

* Clergy
* Politicians
* Journalists
* Media Organizations
* Brand Ambassadors and Marketers
* Activist group leaders
* Celebrities

### Rulers

* Managers
* Politicians
* CEO's
* Judges
* Cops
* Union Bosses

### Warriors

* Military
* Athletes
* Politicians
* Cops
* Emergency Workers
* Addrenaline Junkie related jobs

### Slaves

* Accountants
* Book-keepers
* Electricians
* Plumbers
* Construction Workers
* Factory Workers
* Delivery Drivers
* Truckers
* Small Businesses
* Professional Services
* Restaurant
* Politicians
* Homeless
* Everybody else

You'll notice sometimes there's overlap on roles. Most importantly you'll see that politicians wear all roles. Are simultaneously in all classes.

A politician may be campaigning for themselves, or for a law to pass or fail. They are selling something, priests sell religion and sometimes snake oil cures. Politicians do the same thing.

Politicians are rulers when they are in executive roles and lay down the final word. Rulers are anyone who can be judge jury and executioner in a specific moment for a specific cause, issue, or person.

Cops are rulers, because they have the authority when they pull you over. You must do everything they tell you, even if that means give up your vehicle so they can sell it and raise funds for basketball jersey's for their extra-curricular sports league.

Politicians are warriors when they're debating or running for office. This partially goes under the priest heading as priests are also part of the 'entertainment' side of life. If you look at the first priests, they were setup in ancient Sumerian and Egypt as a way to control mobs of people who could care less about gold, and needed another form of motivation.

Belief in an afterlife is something we all cling onto, I'm agnostic, but I still hope there is one, I believe being energy we could exist in another form after this life, but I also believe that deity isn't a requirement for this, let alone a deity that requires we acknowledge and worship them out of some sort of inferiority or narcissistic complex they might have.

But, I digress. This isn't a relgious text and I'd like those who are faithful to find as much value in this book as those of us who are heathens.

Tangent aside, religion can be looked at anthropologically as method of control, by **fear**. Fear. Fear. Fear. This word. Pay attention to it through out this book. It's a common thread, one that hopefully will be the one that stirs something in you, and makes you begin to think differently.

Sports, movies, and theater. Those also are forms of control, by joy or more precisely distraction.

I've seen plenty of shitty films and wasted time. However, when I'm wasting time binge-watching netflix I'm not writing the single book that could unite the working classes of the world and bring about world peace, and I'm not forming an angry mob to go storm a government building with pitch forks and a viking helmet.  to think about as those on the left while reading this and purpose then can be boiled down to : psychological control. Sales and marketing fit in this as well, they're trying to get you to part with your money. Why? So you have to go back to work to make more, so you can give it to them next week.

Frankly it's so exhausting that you'll waste 40 years of your life doing it, never question the reason or why, probably die poor, or nearly poor with lots of regrets. On the bright side, you were too busy to start an uprising, so the elites go what they wanted.

Caveat: I'm a leftist, or I have been for a long time. I was sympathetic to BLM over the summer. I have called Trump supporters names on social media, and in private ranted about how idiotic it is to not believe in science. Then something awoke in me. Some form of understanding. Maybe it was the riot at the capital.

It dawned on me that if we do not figure out what links us, and gain respect for one another, we will push these people so far to the right, they will become what we *fear* they already are: Terrorists.

Believe it or not, there's more that links us than divides us. Many on the left are as fed up with the government as those on the right. If you read comments on the conservative subreddit as I do quite often, you'll see their pain, their suffering. They feel like society doesn't care about them, and has neglected them.

Fact is, we've moved on from rural communities being important to the cities getting all the respect. This is why they built up their tribes. They fear that the corporate big cities are going to ruin their small town communities.

The irony is in supporting Republicans the party of big business. On the left it's often said that republicans love rich people because they think they'll be one someday. If you're on the left or right and reading this, and your bank account has less than $100k in, I hate to break it to you. You're probably never going to have "much" more than you have now.

Maybe you have a pension or retirement 401k to draw from eventually, so you at least can retire with a roof, and daily food. However, a yacht or private jet, you will never own.

Gist: We are all pawns to the wealthy. We are all slaves.

The sooner you realize that, the sooner you as gladiators can work together and not fight each other. A slave uprising can happen, without violence but through sheer willingness to unite, look beyond our petty disagreements and realize the real enemy: Corporatism.

In all it's forms.

In 1980 the average corporate CEO earned 42 times the average worker. Let's see how this has changed over time:

| Year | CEO Avg | Worker Avg | Ratio | CEO Growth Since 1965 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1965  | 939 k | 42.7 k | 21:1 |0%|
| 1978  | 1.68 M | 51.2 k | 31:1 |78.91%|
| 1989  | 3.13 M | 48.8 k | 61:1 |233.33%|
| 1995  | 6.07 M | 48.8 k | 118:1 |546.43%|
| 2000  | 21.91 M | 51.5 k | 365:1 |2233.33%|
| 2007  | 19.41 M | 53.6 k | 330:1 |1967.09%|
| 2009  | 10.37 M | 55.7 k | 177:1 |1004.37%|
| 2017  | 18.95 M | 57.0 k | 301:1 |1918.10%|
| 2019  | 21.28 M | 58.2 k | 320:1 |2166.24%|

I was born in 1979. Our parents and their parents who grew up roughly from 1940s to 1980s had a lot of perks we don't have now.

Let's take for example the price of college:

* 1970: $6,566
* 1980:  $12,920
* 1990: $34,640
* 2000: $64,280
* 2010: $107,080
* 2020: $143,320
<sub>source: [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/average-cost-college-jumped-incredible-122000732.html)</sub>

Housing?

* 1970: $26k
* 1980: $76k
* 1990: $149k
* 2000: $207k
* 2010: $272k
* 2015: $360k
* 2019: 383k

Now, take a look at the wealth gap table above. You want to know why millenials aren't too happy with boomers?

It's because they are basically earning the same amount on average in wages, and have to spend  ten times more for college than 1980; five to six times more for housing; while at the same time being marginalized as lazy because they can't somehow pull an extra few hundred grand out of air to make up for the difference their parents never had to worry about.

See, the left and the right. They have different worries. Problems are different in rural areas and in cities.

Rural folk saw a lot of jobs in manufacturing, and farming go to Mexico and South America. They blame immigrants, but it didn't take people immigrating to this country to steal their jobs.

Like in Star Wars anger leads to fear, and fear leads to the path to the dark side. Very wise words.

Instead of hate on people who are xenophic, yes, it's bad. Racism is bad. Many who are racist don't realize they even are. This book isn't about dealing with that though. Understand why they are that way. It's because of manufactured consent.

In 1980 Atwater gave a very telling interview where he basically exposed the entire philosophy of the GOP and southern strategy was to use racism and bigotry to recruit white conservatives. This worked so well, it's the reason most southern blacks are democrat and most southern whites are conservative.

In the context of tribalism this divide just makes the case even more that blacks and latinos (who also are more democrat than republican) are "against" them.

This causes them to look inside and say, racism isn't so bad, because these people really do hate me, and really are "out to get me".

### Win: Corporatists

Whether they know it or not, corporatists in America are utilizing a strategy based on coercing the 99% to fight amongst itself (e.g. the 53%). And it's as much liberals' fault that it works as it is conservatives'.

You know the quote from "It's a Wonderful Life" that says: "Every time a bell rings an angel gets it's wings"? Let's reword this to better suit our tribes.

"Every time a (insert your tribe) says (insert a slang or derogatory term) a CEO increases their wealth and fires 2 workers."

Let's try it, if you can't think of a good slang here's a few:

#### Right Derogatory Slurs

* Extremist
* Terrorist
* Conservative
* Bigot
* Racist
* fanataic
* fool
* idiot
* redneck
* sheep
* lemming
* loser
* mysoginist
* nutjob
* obstructionist
* racist
* radical
* snowflake
* zealot

#### Left Derogatory Slurs

* Commie
* Socialist
* crony
* elitist
* extremist
* antifa
* fool
* hack
* hippie
* idiot
* hypocrite
* jackass
* lemming
* sheep
* loser
* moron
* nitwit
* racist
* radical
* libtard
* snowflake
* troll

There sure are a lot of ways for us to pad the pockets of CEO's. Go to twitter and just start flinging shit all over the place, and I'm sure Jeff Bezos, Trump, and Elon Musk will thank you as their stock rises.

Are you getting it?

We must unite. Forget about socialism. Forget about fascism. Forget if someone supported x person you hate. Forget if they voted for Trump or Bernie or Pelosi or McConnel.

The enemy isn't democrat or republican voters. The enemy is the establishment, and I know I sound like Bernie, and I admire what he stands for, but I can also word that as the enemy is the swamp. Everyone who walks through those doors in the Capitol. They are members of the swamp.

Even Bernie Sanders. Even Josh Hawley. Even Ted Cruz. Even Alexandria Ocassia-cortez.

They all caucus with democrats or republicans, even if they're independent. It's the only way to retain power.

But what if I told you there's another way? What if I told you there's a political movement to set aside petty grievances, even major ones and we all have major resentments. Especially after the past four years. The divide has been growing wider and deeper.

The events at the capital have shown us that we're moving into dangerous waters. I too ranted and raved about these terrorists attacking us from the right. I said as much earlier. I am willing to admit though when I am wrong.

The right are not terrorists. I do not condone what happened in D.C. But the majority of those on the right are our friends, neighbors, fellow church members, and whether we like it or not family.

Same goes for the people on the left who want socialism. They're not your enemy. Seriously, corporatism and capitalism is so engrained in society that it'd be impossible for socialism to take hold in America.

Let it go. Just let go. Breath. Meditate for a few minutes and say to yourself. I accept my brothers and sisters on the opposite side. I can forgive them, if they can forgive me. We have bigger fish to fry.

Let this become your mantra. Then organize with us, to take over both parties and make way for the rise of third parties.

European countries function much better not because of socialism, but because of the way parties work in Europe. It's not uncommon for a new party to rise to power for a few years, and then fall back into obscurity.

This is healthy for a democracy, it brings new ideas. It lets more people run for office, it makes differing opinions dictate the future of the country instead of extremism on both sides.

What I propose could take on many different forms. We'd need to meet, maybe elect our own leaders to meet and put forth ideas to their local communities ideas.

The best solutions I can think of involve the one party solution or the two party solution.

### The Two Party Solution

This one is probably easiest to swallow. A lot of people get a bad taste in their mouth to ever consider themselves a Democrat or Republican. I get a bad taste considering myself anything but Independent.

The way this works is we create an organization. We meet, discuss our very basic core goals. I think maybe so much as being simply for Ranked Choice Voting, and ending Citizen's united and changing how elections can be funded.

The two party method is simply: I'll vote for you in my state, you vote for me in your state... In otherwords, if I'm a leftist in a red state and a member of our group is running. I will support them. The caveat here is this creates another tribe, but if you think of it as a 'workers' tribe, and that we outnumber everybody else, it's not so bad.

Even better would be running candidates who are really just 'proxies'. Each state will have their own app, or place to vote for issues that matter to them. The proxy then votes with the majority on every issue. Failure to do so, is expellment from the organization.

Example on how this works. I live in Utah. I'm a Bernie Supporter. John Doe is selected to run as a GOP senator loyal to our group above all else.

In the senate they vote to legalize marijuana. Utah members go online and vote for this issue. It's close, but it's 54 to 50 in favor of legalization. Senator John, votes in favor of legalization. No question.

He takes the will of the people to congress, nothing more, but gets to keep his salary and benefits of the office.

#### One Party Plan

The other option. Many Trump supporters are fed up with conservatives as are many libertarians. So, why not just become a Democrat? The majority party right now is the democrats. It's looking more and more like a lot of Republicans to save power might start flocking over to the Democrats. If you can't beat them join them. 

Who needs ranked choice voting, when there's only one party and everyone is a member? See, each party has caucuses, so we create the worker's caucus. Again same goals as before, same rules: vote with the will of the people. 

The power brokers who created and came up with the divide and conquor strategies. They never accounted for the internet. Big tech recently has shown that in times of trouble (to their shareholders) they are willing to censor, and they do have that right. It's not a 1st amendment violation. It is an ethical one though, at what point have they gone too far? 

At what point does it backfire? Maybe the FBI could use social media to find terrorists that they censor. Maybe it pushes more and more people to darker corners of the internet making it harder to form bigger communities, but also more likely to create black markets and break laws. So much for "law and order". 

As part of my thinking, I think we also need a new media channel. One that airs grievances from the left and right and center and is more
